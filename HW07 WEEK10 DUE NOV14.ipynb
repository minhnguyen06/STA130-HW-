    "Model Extensions: We reviewed how different models (model3_fit, model4_fit, model5_linear_form, model6_linear_form, and model7_linear_form) were developed incrementally. Each model built on its predecessor by adding more predictors, refining interactions, and narrowing the set of variables based on significance, with the goal of improving prediction accuracy and generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizability: We analyzed the generalizability of the models to different Pokémon generations. Specifically, we checked how models trained on data from earlier generations (like Generation 1) performed when predicting outcomes for subsequent generations (such as Generation 6) using in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values. We also discussed how adjusting for variables like \"Generation\" and \"Type\" could help improve prediction across different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: We talked about the issue of multicollinearity in the design matrix (model4_spec.exog) caused by high correlations between predictors. This multicollinearity can destabilize the model, inflate standard errors, and affect out-of-sample generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centering and Scaling: We briefly covered the use of centering and scaling continuous predictor variables (such as Attack, Speed, etc.) in the model formulation. This helps standardize the data, making it easier for the model to interpret and reducing issues with large coefficient values or numerical instability.\n",

It also introduces interaction terms that were identified as significant in earlier models, like specific Pokémon types (Normal, Water) and generations (2, 5). This refinement helps focus the model on the most relevant predictors and their interactions, reducing its complexity and potentially improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",

This extension allows for more nuanced interactions, capturing non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcome, which could lead to better predictive performance.\n",
