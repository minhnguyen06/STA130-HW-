    "Summary of Key Concepts \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantiles: A quantile is a statistical value that divides a dataset into intervals based on a specified percentage. For example, the 2.5% quantile is the value below which 2.5% of the data points fall. When calculating a quantile, the position can be a non-integer (e.g., 0.5). This indicates that the quantile lies between two values in the dataset, and interpolation is used to find the exact value. \n",
    "2. Calculating the 2.5% Quantile: For a dataset (e.g., [1, 2, 3, ..., 20]), to find the 2.5% quantile: Calculate 2.5% of the total count. For 20 values, 0.025 × 20 = 0.5 0.025×20=0.5. Since 0.5 is not a valid index, interpolate between the first (1) and second (2) values. The 2.5% quantile is calculated as 1 + 0.5 × ( 2 − 1 ) = 1.5 1+0.5×(2−1)=1.5. This means that 2.5% of the values in the dataset fall below 1.5. \n",
    "3. Confidence Intervals: A confidence interval provides a range of values within which a population parameter (like the mean) is expected to lie, with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%). To construct a 95% confidence interval using bootstrapped sample means: Calculate the 2.5% quantile and 97.5% quantile of the bootstrapped means. The confidence interval is defined as: \\text{Confidence Interval} = [\\text{2.5% quantile}, \\text{97.5% quantile}] This means that you are 95% confident that the true population mean lies between the values given by the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles."

    "# Question 1 \n",
    "The \"Pre-lecture\" video (above) mentioned the \"standard error of the mean\" as being the \"standard deviation\" of the distribution bootstrapped means. What is the difference between the \"standard error of the mean\" and the \"standard deviation\" of the original data? What distinct ideas do each of these capture? Explain this concisely in your own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation means how spread out the data is from the sample mean, and the standard error of the mean is how accurate the mean of the sample is, comparing to the mean of the actual population. Standard deviation (SD) focuses on the variability of the sample dataset, while standard error of the mean (SEM) focuses on the precision of the sample with regards to population. The higher the SD the further the data spreads away from the sample mean, and SEM decreases as the sample size increases, meaning lower SEM indicates more reliable sample."

This means that the statistic may not fully capture the variability present in the entire population. As a result, while the population parameter provides the true value, the sample statistic only gives us an estimate. Confidence intervals help us account for the uncertainty associated with this estimate by indicating a range where we expect the population parameter to lie. In essence, the population parameter reflects the true characteristic of the population more accurately, while the sample statistic offers an approximation of what the population may look like"

    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping begins with a sample drawn from a population. From this sample, we create multiple new datasets by randomly selecting elements with replacement, ensuring that each new dataset has the same number of elements as the original sample. This process is repeated multiple times, resulting in a collection of bootstrapped datasets that reflect the variability of the population.\n",

This allows us to evaluate the variability of the statistic without needing to collect more sample in multiple trials. Bootstrapping is particularly useful when obtaining more data is impractical due to lack of time or resource.\n",

    "To assess if my hypothesized population mean is plausible, I will use bootstrapping to generate 1,000 to 10,000 bootstrapped datasets from the sample. For each bootstrapped dataset, I will calculate the sample mean and then determine the 95% confidence interval for these means. I will compare the hypothesized population mean to this confidence interval. If the hypothesized mean falls within the interval, it suggests that my guess is plausible, as the sample mean reflects the population mean at a 95% confidence level."
